# Daily-Dose-of-DSA

I am doing Leetcode-style problems in Javascript/Typescript and Java. 
I amshooting for every weekday for the time being. I am giving myself about 20 minutes per problem. 
The pseudocode is, quite frankly, overdone. 
I know it would be cooler to leave it out, however I am solving these problems interview-style:
Out loud, writing pseudocode for someone else to follow my train of thought. 
Hopefully anyone who sees the pseudo-code can follow "what I'm saying" along with the code.
