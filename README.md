# Daily-Dose-of-DSA

I am doing Leetcode-style problems in Java, and Javascript/Typescript. I am
shooting for every weekday for the time being. The pseudocode is, quite frankly,
overdone. I know it would be cooler to leave it out, however I am solving these
problems interview-style: Out loud, writing pseudocode for someone else to
follow my train of thought. Hopefully anyone who sees the pseudo-code can follow
"what I'm saying" along with the code.
